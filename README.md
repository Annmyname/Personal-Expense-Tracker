# Personal Expense Tracker â€“ Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Personal Expenses Dashboard is an interactive financial analysis tool built using **Power BI** and **Python (pandas)**. It provides insights into income and expenses for 2021, helping users understand financial activity and make informed decisions through visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Dataset Used
The dataset contains income and expense statements for 2021, with **10 columns** and **487 rows**, covering multiple income and expenditure categories. Data is processed and analyzed to generate meaningful insights.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Processing and Transformation
- Cleaned and structured raw data using **Python pandas**, handling missing values and correcting data types.  
- Performed calculations and transformations in pandas DataFrames to derive key metrics (e.g., weekly/monthly totals, remaining balance).  

### 2. Data Analysis and Aggregation
- Aggregated and summarized data using `groupby` and pivot tables.  
- Calculated top spending categories, weekly/monthly expenses, and income flows.  
- Applied filters and conditional logic to categorize transactions for better visualization.  

### 3. Dashboard Development in Power BI
- Imported processed DataFrame into **Power BI** for interactive visualization.  
- Created visual components:  
  - **Income Analysis:** Hierarchical view of income streams and sources.  
  - **Expense Analysis:** Debit, credit, and remaining balance charts.  
  - **Weekly & Monthly Expenses:** Trend analysis and category breakdowns.  
  - **Top 5 Expenses:** Highlighting major expenditure areas.  
  - **Monthly Transition Charts:** Combining income and expense flows.  
  - **KPI Cards:** Key financial indicators for quick insights.  

### 4. Automation & Enhancement
- Developed Python scripts to automate data cleaning and preprocessing for dashboard updates.  
- Enabled dynamic filtering in Power BI using slicers and calculated measures.  

## Dashboard Components
- **Income Analysis:** Overview of income streams and sources.  
- **Expense Analysis:** Visual representation of outflows and inflows, with weekly/monthly breakdowns.  
- **Top Expenses:** Identification of the top five expenditure categories.  
- **KPIs:** Key financial metrics for quick assessment.  

## Technical Skills Utilized
- **Data Processing:** Python (pandas) for cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.  
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI for interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards.  
- **Automation:** Python scripting to streamline data updates.  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for project management.  

## Soft Skills Demonstrated
- **Analytical Thinking:** Translating raw data into actionable insights.  
- **Attention to Detail:** Ensuring data accuracy and meaningful visualization.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Handling data inconsistencies and optimizing dashboard performance.  
- **Communication:** Presenting complex financial information in an easy-to-understand format.
